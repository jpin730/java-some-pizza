# Java Some Pizza

This is a simple Java application that simulates a pizza ordering system. It uses JPA and Hibernate to interact with a MySQL database.

## Prepare database

Run docker-compose to start a MySQL database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Database credentials are in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To stop the database:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
